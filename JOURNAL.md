Total Hours Spent: 18 hours

Day 1 (June 27):

11:12

Goals:
I want to make a voice assistant like Siri or Alexa. 
I want to learn how this type of stuff works. I'm new to this, so this is going to be rough.
Also I plan on using ChatGPT and YouTube for help.
The plan is to run everything on my PC and export it onto the Raspberry Pi.

Parts: 
Raspberry Pi 4
Micro SD (16GB)
USB Microphone
Speaker (3.5mm or Bluetooth)
Case (for carrying; plan on designing it)

I guess the first thing to do is to set up the Raspberry Pi so that I can upload the OS onto it.
I plan to use Python primarily and utilize voice recognition.

First step is to update Python because everything will be done on the terminal.
The system won't allow me to download the libraries, so I'm lost.
The error is because the Raspberry Pi OS is preventing.
The plan is to make a local folder and run it inside a Virtual Environment.
Finished installing the libraries. To activate the VM, I need to run the command: source my_voice_env/bin/activate to access.

Total Hours Spent: 2
