Day 1 (June 27):
11:12
Goals:
I want to make a voice assistant like Siri or Alexa. 
I want to learn how this type of stuff works. I'm new to this, so this is going to be rough.
Parts:
Raspberry Pi 4
Micro SD (16GB)
USB Microphone
Speaker (3.5mm or Bluetooth)
Wi-Fi
Case (for carrying; plan on designing it)
I guess the first thing to do is to set up the Raspberry Pi so that I can upload the OS onto it.
I plan to use Python primarily and utilize an open-source API for voice recognition, and possibly add an AI voice assistant.
