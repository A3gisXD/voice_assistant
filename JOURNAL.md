Day 1 (June 27):

11:12

Goals:
I want to make a voice assistant like Siri or Alexa. 
I want to learn how this type of stuff works. I'm new to this, so this is going to be rough.
Also I plan on using ChatGPT and YouTube for help.

Parts: 
Raspberry Pi 4
Micro SD (16GB)
USB Microphone
Speaker (3.5mm or Bluetooth)
Case (for carrying; plan on designing it)

I guess the first thing to do is to set up the Raspberry Pi so that I can upload the OS onto it.
I plan to use Python primarily and utilize voice recognition.

First step is to update Python because everything will be done on the terminal.

11:28

The system won't allow me to download the libraries, so I'm lost.

11:32

The error is because the Raspberry Pi OS is preventing.
The plan is to make a local folder and run it inside a Virtual Environment.

11:34 

Finished installing the libraries. To activate the VM, I need to run the command: source my_voice_env/bin/activate to access.
